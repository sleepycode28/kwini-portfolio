            <div class="project-detail-info">
                <p>For this project, I developed a complete 12-day promotional email campaign for PumPums, focused on driving sales, customer engagement, and product reviews during a seasonal marketing push. The campaign was strategically designed to position PumPums as a go-to comfort and wellness essential.</p>
                <h3>Key Contributions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Campaign Strategy & Concept Development:</strong> Created the overarching concept: “12 Days of Comfort — New Deal Every Day.” Developed a structured, day-by-day promo plan including BOGO deals, percentage discounts, free shipping days, flash promotions, and engagement-driven giveaways. Integrated a user engagement mechanic where the first 3 commenters or reviewers each day receive a free PumPums pack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Email Marketing Execution:</strong> Wrote 12 complete daily email copies, each with: Subject line, Preview text, Banner/header text, Body copy, CTA, "Where to Shop" cross-platform links. Ensured each email aligned with the daily promo offer and the overall comfort-focused brand message.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Media Copywriting:</strong> Created daily social media captions for all 12 days. Ensured captions matched the tone of the campaign: fun, relatable, upbeat, and engagement-driven. Included prompts for comments, UGC, and fast-action responses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Website Banner Copy:</strong> Crafted text for two types of banners: Teaser Banner (before launch) and Sale Banner (during the event). Added strong CTAs (“Sign Up for Early Access,” “Shop Today’s Deal”) and clear positioning taglines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Promo Breakdown Structure:</strong> Organized the entire campaign into a clear, easy-to-follow 12-day promotional map with: Offers, Email subjects, Social captions, and Notes for marketing execution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Brand Positioning & Visual Direction:</strong> Defined the visual concept for website banners and email headers: cozy, festive, soft tones, sparkles, holiday comfort themes. Ensured all messaging consistently framed PumPums as a comfort essential for holiday self-care and cycle support.</li>
                </ul>
                 <h3>Overall Impact:</h3>
                <p>I produced a full end-to-end marketing campaign package including strategy, email sequences, banner copy, and social content. The work showcases my strengths in UX writing, email marketing, content strategy, and promotional planning — representing a complete sample project ready for portfolio presentation.</p>
