# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for Kwini, a professional with expertise in SEO, Email & Design, and Programming. The site showcases her skills, services, and projects.

## Implemented Features

*   **Homepage:** A landing page with a hero section, projects overview, tools, an about me summary, and a contact form.
*   **Projects Section:** A four-card layout showcasing projects in SEO & Web Copywriting, Email & Designs, Code Programming, and AI Generation.
*   **Project Pages:** Separate pages for SEO, with detailed information about each project.
*   **About Me Page:** A more detailed about me page with a CV.
*   **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and work on different screen sizes.

## Current Task: Update Projects Section

*   **Problem:** The previous "Services" section did not accurately reflect the user's work and needed a visual update.
*   **Solution:** Renamed the section to "Projects," added a new "AI Generation" card, and adjusted the layout to a responsive four-column grid.
