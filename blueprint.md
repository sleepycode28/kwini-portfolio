## Implemented Features

*   **Interactive Animations:** Advanced hover animations on project cards to enhance user experience.
*   **Layout Adjustments:** Reduced padding in the "Hero" and "About Me" sections for a more compact design.
*   **Content Correction:** Corrected job description mismatches on the "About Me" page.
*   **Copyright Update:** Updated the copyright year to 2025 across all pages.

## Current Task: Padding Reduction, Content Correction, and Copyright Update

*   **Problem:**
    *   The "Hero" and "About Me" sections had excessive padding, creating unnecessary white space.
    *   The job descriptions on the "About Me" page were incorrect.
    *   The copyright year in the footer was outdated.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Modified `style.css` to reduce the `padding` for the `.home` and `.about` sections.
    *   Updated `about.html` to correct the job descriptions.
    *   Changed the copyright year to 2025 in the footer of all HTML files (`index.html`, `about.html`, `ai-generation.html`, `maintenance.html`, `seo.html`).
